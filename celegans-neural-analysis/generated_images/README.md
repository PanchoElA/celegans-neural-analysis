## generated_images — Static figure assets

This folder stores static images (PNG/JPG/SVG) produced by the analysis scripts and visualization generators. These images are intended as quick previews, figures for reports, or fallbacks when interactive HTML is not desired.

Typical contents
- PCA and trajectory plots (e.g., `PCA_Trajectory_3D.png`, `PCA_2D_projection.png`)
- Component loadings and scree plots (e.g., `principal_components_top5.png`, `neuron_loadings_top5_PCs.png`)
- Behavior timeline and overlay figures (e.g., `Neural_Behavior_Timeline.png`)
- Colorbars / legends separated for publication (`Colorbar_Separate.png`)

How these images were produced
- Most static figures are generated by scripts in `analysis_code/` such as:
  - `generate_PCA_Final_Clean.py`
  - `generate_PCA_trajectory.py`
  - `PCA_Enhanced_Analysis.py`
  - `Raster_Plot.py`

- Some figures were created as intermediate outputs by the interactive generators in `interactive_code/`.

Quick commands (from repo root)

```powershell
# Activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Produce main static PCA figures
python analysis_code/generate_PCA_Final_Clean.py

# Produce trajectory snapshots (if the script is present)
python analysis_code/generate_PCA_trajectory.py
```

Where to look
- The images are stored directly inside this folder. Filenames may vary slightly depending on script parameters. If you need a specific image regenerated, search for the producing script in `analysis_code/` and run it.

Performance notes
- Large datasets can make static plotting take several seconds to minutes depending on the plotting backend and your machine. PNG exports are slower than interactive HTML rendering because of rasterization.

Troubleshooting
- If a script fails with missing-import errors, ensure you activated the virtualenv and installed `requirements.txt`.
- If a produced image looks empty or truncated, check that the input CSV `neural_data_dataframe.csv` exists in the repo root and that the script completes without runtime errors.

Next steps (optional)
- I can add a small manifest (`generated_images/manifest.csv`) that lists each file with the script that produced it and generation timestamp. This helps reproducibility.
